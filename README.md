**Introduction**:     
This package implements a fast and robust Face Detection machine by C++, using the tricks of extracting skin info and transforming to YCbCr space.          

**MFC and Visual C++**     
This program is only available for Visual C++ 6.0, Visual Studio 2008, Visual Studio 2010 or some higher versions.         
Also, **MFC is indispensable, which serves as our fundamental platform of this implementation**. Note that this Microsoft product is quite essential and convenient for BMP Image processing, as it consists of lots of useful structs and functions.      

**Usage:**      
1. Build the project on MFC, and you can decide how to construct the viewing inteface!
